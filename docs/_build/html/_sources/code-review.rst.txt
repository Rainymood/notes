Code review checklist
=====================

  The primary purpose of code review is to make sure **that the overall code health
  of Google's code base is improving over time.** All of the tools and processes of
  code review are designed to this end. In order to accomplish this, a series of
  trade-offs have to be balanced.

Requirements

* |checkbox| Does the code spark joy?
* |checkbox| Does the code satisfy the requirements?

Design

* |checkbox| Does the code follow the Single Responsibility Principle?
* |checkbox| Is writing delegated to a writer? (code smell of `.save()`)
* |checkbox| Is data IO pushed to the boundaries (code smell)
* |checkbox| Is dependency injection (DI) followed? 

Maintainability

* |checkbox| Is the code easy to read & follow?
* |checkbox| Are the classes/variable names clear and descriptive?
* |checkbox| Is there code duplication (DRY)?

Testing

* |checkbox| Is new logic unit tested?
* |checkbox| Are all edge cases tested?
* |checkbox| Is there an integration test for a new use case?
